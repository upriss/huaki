<h3 class="title">Mandolin Sheet Music</h3>

Printed mandolin sheet music was often published by small publishers.
It was mostly not consistently collected by libraries. On this site, I am providing 
links to sheet music for plucked string orchestras that is in the public domain
and available on-line. 

<h4 class='red'>Mandolin sheet music</h4>

From the archives of the <a href="mandoline">
Braunschweig Mandolin Orchestra</a>. The works here should 
be in the public domain because their composers died more than 70 years ago and 
the publication was more than 50 years ago. My reason for posting these here is 
because it is basically impossible to find them anywhere else. If any of these 
are actually still copyrighted, please let me know and I will remove them. 

<ul>
<li><a href="sheetmusic.html">original compositions for mandolin</a>

<h4 class='red'>Mandolin journals:</h4>

In the early 20th century mandolin sheet music was often distributed in monthly or
bi-monthly journals. Each journal contained some information about local
mandolin activities and a few music scores, usually composed by the editor and
his colleagues. Some libraries appear to
have some paper issues of these journals but often incomplete. Some collections have
been digitised, but are difficult to find on the web.

<h4 class='red'>Archiving Sheet Music on the Web</h4>

Just posting sheet music on a website does not guarantee that it will be available
in the long term. It is probably best to upload materials to
commercial or community maintained archives. The
<a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> is the largest non-profit library 
that archives web pages and other documents. 
It is a good idea to make sure that materials are archived by the Internet Archive
(by searching for it on their site and then uploading it).
It is also possible to upload files directly to that archive.
The biggest sheet music website is <a href="https://imslp.org/">IMSLP</a>.
I found its upload procedures somewhat complicated, but it is probably the best
place for scanned sheet music. My own website (the one you are just looking at) is
hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> which is likely to be available
long term. But I don't know whether Github approves of people posting materials
other than software. 

<p>

With respect to copyright: in most countries sheet music is in the public domain if
the composer and arranger of the music died more than 70 years ago and the 
publication was printed more than 50 years ago. In USA, works published before
1929 are in the public domain (otherwise USA copyright law is complicated).
In case the identity of the composer/arranger is unknown, it is in the public
domain 70 years after publication or after it is reasonable to assume that the
author died over 70 years ago. In France and Spain copyright protection can last
longer. In Canada, works whose composers/arrangers died before 1971 are usually
in the public domain. (The main <a href="https://imslp.org/">IMSLP</a> servers are
in Canada.) In summary, most works that were composed in the Golden Age
of the mandolin (i.e. 1900-1920) are in the public domain or will be in the 
public domain in the near future. The works of the following mandolin composers are still
protected but will be free soon: Kok (died 1954), Maciocchi (1955), Ranieri (1956),
Bitelli (1956).
